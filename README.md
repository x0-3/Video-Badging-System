# Video-Badging-System
This project aims to develop a secure access control system for a site or location. The system will control access to the site by verifying the identity of the person attempting to enter, using both visual and electronic verification methods.  
  



## Features  
- Secure access control for a site or location
-Verification of user identity using a badge
-Visual verification using a camera
-Electronic verification using information stored on the badge
-Display of access information on an LCD screen
-LED indicator to show access status
-Automatic door opening after successful verification
